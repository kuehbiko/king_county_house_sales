# King County House Sales Interactive Dashboard

This is a Data Visualisation project that features an interactive Tableau dashboard with sliding filters and a calendar widget. 

The dashboard is a visualisation of the King County House Sales dataset taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction), providing an overview of the 
- Fluctuations in daily average house prices
- Average house prices according to zipcode
- Distributions of house prices
- Distributions of bedrooms and bathrooms per house
- Correlation of house condition and view on house prices

Additionally, sliding filters and a calendar widget allow viewers to drill down on the month/day, year built, square foot living and square foot lot.

View and interact with the full dashboard on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kuebiko/viz/KingCountyHouseSales_16911213453610/KingCountyHouseSales)

### The Dataset
The King County House Sales dataset is taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction).

### Key Takeaways
In this project, I learnt how to create interactive filters and to connect the filters to all sheets on the dashboard, and how to connect it to only selected sheets. 

Being able to connect filters to some sheets on the dashboard but not others is useful because allows the audience to drill down on certain aspects of the visualisation while also maintaining a high level view of other aspects. For example, the Month/Year filter on the dashboard shows the audience the trend of average house prices over a selected month, while usage of the calendar widget can show them a more in-depth details of the houses sold on that particular day.
