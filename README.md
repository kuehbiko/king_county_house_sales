# King County House Sales Interactive Dashboard

This is a Data Visualisation project that features an interactive Tableau dashboard with sliding filters and a calendar widget. 

The dashboard is a visualisation of the King County House Sales dataset taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction), providing an overview of the 
- Fluctuations in daily average house prices
- Average house prices according to zipcode
- Distributions of house prices
- Distributions of bedrooms and bathrooms per house
- Correlation of house condition and view on house prices

Additionally, sliding filters and a calendar widget allow viewers to drill down on the month/day, year built, square foot living and square foot lot.

View and interact with the full dashboard on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kuebiko/viz/KingCountyHouseSales_16911213453610/KingCountyHouseSales)

## The Dataset
The King County House Sales dataset is taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction). The tags on this dataset mark it as a cleaned dataset. However, let's do a cursory check to fully ensure that we are working with data that is free of null values and errors.

## The Dashboard
I will briefly describe the process of creating this dashboard before convering the key takeaways from this project.

### Sheet 1: Line Chart of Daily Average House Prices

### Sheet 2: Geospatial Map of Average House Prices By Zipcode

### Sheet 3: Histogram Distribution of House Prices

### Sheet 4: Heatmap of House View vs House Condition

### Sheet 5 & 6: Histogram Distribution of Bedrooms and Bathrooms
